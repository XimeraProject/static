# static Ximera

## Using this as a TeXShop engine

Open the MacOS terminal.  First you will need to install some additional TeX files.
```bash
cd ~/Library
mkdir -p texmf/tex/latex
cd ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex
git clone https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex.git
cd ximeraLatex
git checkout development
```

Then install the engine and make it executable.
```bash
cd ~/Library/TeXShop/Engines
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/XimeraProject/static/master/ximera.engine
chmod +x ximera.engine
```

Then restart TeXShop, and create a file with
``\documentclass{ximera}`` and choose ``ximera`` as the engine from
the top bar.  When you click ``Typeset`` then you will see a PDF, but
also an .html file will be created.

## Using ``compile.sh``

If you have [the development version of
ximeraLaTeX](https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex/tree/development)
installed in your local ``texmf`` tree, then the ``compile.sh`` script
can be used to transform TeX into HTML.

## Using ``xake``

If you have installed
[``xake``](https://github.com/XimeraProject/xake) then you can also
create static HTML with **support for SVG images**.  You will also
need to have [the development version of
ximeraLaTeX](https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex/tree/development)
installed in your ``texmf`` tree in order to produce HTML with a
``<head>`` that points to the Ximera server at Ohio State.

In this case, [the resulting page ``index.html``](https://ximeraproject.github.io/static/) was generated by running ``xake compile index.tex``.
