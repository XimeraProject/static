# static Ximera

If you have installed
[``xake``](https://github.com/XimeraProject/xake) then you can also
create static HTML.  You will also need to have [the development
version of
ximeraLaTeX](https://github.com/XimeraProject/ximeraLatex/tree/development)
installed in your ``texmf`` tree in order to produce HTML with a
``<head>`` that points to the Ximera server at Ohio State.

In this case, [the resulting page ``index.html``](https://ximeraproject.github.io/static/) was generated by running ``xake compile index.tex``.
